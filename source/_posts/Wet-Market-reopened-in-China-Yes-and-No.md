Recently there has been a public outcry accusing the "reopen" of the so-called "wet market" in China, and the anger got endorsement from the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who made a statement to urge the Chinese government to permanently ban "wildlife wet markets and all markets that sell illegal wildlife".

Did China indeed risk the public health to reopen the "dangerous" wet markets, which is widely associated with the COVID-19?

It all depends on how "wet market" is interpreted.

'Wet markets, as opposed to dry markets, which sell non-perishable goods such as grain or household products, are simply places that offer a wide range of fresh produce. Some, but not all, also sell live animals. They are referred to as "wet" owing to the fact that floors are often hosed down after vendors wash vegetables or clean fish.

Wet markets that sell live animals can risk creating the types of dangerous conditions where viruses can spread from animals to humans, due to the close quarters and potentially unsanitary practices -- especially, if they keep rare animals or those captured from the wild, experts say.

The 2003 SARS epidemic, for example, was linked to the sale of civet cats in Guangdong province.

Most wet markets, however, are not virus petri-dishes filled with exotic animals ready to be slaughtered.

For a large proportion of people in China and across Asia, they are just places to go to buy fresh food, such as chicken, pork, fish and vegetables, at affordable prices.

To put it blunt, there were indeed certain amount of wet markets do slaughter illegal wildlife - but that only makes a tiny fraction of them.

Although some of the markets sell wild animals, the vast majority of them do not. Such markets are common not only in China, but throughout Asia and parts of the Middle East.
{% endblockquote %}

Villainizing "wet market" is misleading and irresponsible. Wet markets are vital to meeting the day-to-day needs of ordinary people across the world - by strict definition, the famous Fish Market in Sydney also fall in the category of wet market.

WHO has made their point - wet markets are not born evil, if they are well regulated:

Up till now, there has been no sign or proof that the wildlife trading is active in China.

# Do Chinese people eat bats?

{% blockquote France24 https://observers.france24.com/en/20200203-china-coronavirus-bat-soup-debunk-videos-viral-palau-indonesia Is bat soup a delicacy in China? We debunk a rumour on the origin of the coronavirus %}
'Chinese people eating bats, then coronavirus came out.' has been a popular theory on social media after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, and it got the endorsement from several celebrities, politicians and for sure, Fox News and OAN.

The accusations always come with viral videos of 'Chinese eating bat soup'. Nevertheless, no proof could support that the videos were filmed in China - while a few were filmed in Palau and Indonesia, verified by a French media.

Videos of Asian people selling or eating bats have been circulating on social media since news broke of the coronavirus outbreak in China, with claims that bats are a possible origin of the new virus. The FRANCE 24 Observers team investigated six of the most-shared videos. Five were filmed outside China, in Palau and Indonesia. None of the videos had any documented link to the outbreak.
{% endblockquote %}

The origin of the coronavirus stays unknown, while no proof could support the virus transmitted to human through 'bat soup':

But as it turns out, the market may not have been the cause of the outbreak at all. A new study shows that the early known victims had no contact with the market. And although the virus, at present, does seem to have originated in bats, it’s unclear how it made its way to humans. It’s quite likely no chowing down on the creatures of the night was involved.
{%endblockquote%}

Bat is viewed as a delicacy in many cultures, esp. among the aboriginals in the Pacific Island countries, e.g. Palau is quite famous for its bat dishes. In some of the communities in South Eastern Asia (1) and Africa (2) people also have the tradition to treat bats as food.

Nevertheless, bats have never been a part of the Chinese cuisine - It is widely speculated that bats were treated as food among certain 'novelty hunters' in Southern China, but it is yet to be proved.
