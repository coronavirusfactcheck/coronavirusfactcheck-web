# Our Mission

We are a not-for-profit, nonpartisan volunteer group aims to bring transparency and fairness through offering the readers with 'clean facts' on the subject of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our fact-checking covers rumors, myths and misinformation from traditional media, social media, politicians' speech and etc.

We encourage good discussions that are based on facts.
We are against racism and hate speeches.

# Our Vision

Nowadays there are too many 'opinions' and too few 'truths'. We believe people have the right to make their own judgement based on clean & unbiased facts. We do not offer OPINIONS, as they could be easily manipulated, and too often biased. We offer solid FACTS from solid research & neutral writing style.

# Why we are doing this?

There is a tremendous amount of FAKE NEWS all over the Internet, and when a global pandemic like COVID-19 is in place, it could be particularly dangerous. It brings chaos, mistrust, racism and eventually blood. We would like to offer the readers a new perspective, a platform to obtain the reliable facts, not the manipulated hatred towards other ethnic groups or nations.

# Our topic selection process

We closely monitor the traditional media as well as social media, and we are more than happy to hear the voice of our readers. We prioritize/evaluate the topics based on the newsworthiness, the potential damage it might engender, as well as the feasibility of fact-checking.

# How do we fact check the claims?

As a routine first step, we would run a holistic online research on Google, aiming to get a holistic touch of the topic. As a second step, we would largely rely on primary data & credible secondary data to fulfil the story line with solid facts. All the data sources will be clearly labelled.


# Why critical thinking is important?
Because some media are deliberately lying, or manipulating the fact.
